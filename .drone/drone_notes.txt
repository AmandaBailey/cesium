- We no longer need to build Drone--just run it from the Docker container as
  outlined in the installation instructions.  Note, the docker cmd has to be
  modified slightly a) to mount /var/lib/drone with correct permissions and b)
  to host on the correct port:

  ~$ cat launch_drone.sh
  sudo docker run \
      --volume /var/lib/drone:/var/lib/drone:z \
      --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      --env-file /etc/drone/dronerc \
      --restart=always \
      --publish=8080:8000 \
      --detach=true \
      --name=drone \
      drone/drone:0.4

- For building from source: follow the instructions on github.com:drone/drone
  line by line to build, e.g. do not forget to set

    export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1

- If the server shows internal docker errors, restart docker (may be a
  firewall issue on CentOS, for example).
