### README FOR MLTP ###


Flask app for machine learning web service. 

In progress - much more to be added here!







0. System dependecies:
	a. The following Python packages (in addition to those that ship with Anaconda) are required:
		flask rethinkdb beautifulsoup4 seaborn mpld3 requests flask-googleauth flask-oauth flask-mail flask-login simplejson psutil parse flask-restful
	b. Install and configure Disco
	c. Install and configure RethinkDB
	d. Install and configure Docker - then build required images from Dockerfiles ("featurize", "build_model", "predict", "extract_custom_features")
	e. Install and configure nginx

1. Required configuration:
	a. In the file cfg.py, locate the following variables and set them to reflect your system architecture:
	
		PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
			
			and
			
		MODELS_FOLDER, UPLOAD_FOLDER, FEATURES_FOLDER
		
			or leave as is and create the following directories:
				~/Data/flask_mltp/flask_uploads
				~/Data/flask_mltp/extracted_features
				~/Data/flask_mltp/classifier_models
				~/Data/flask_mltp/logs

2. Starting the app
	a. Run in debug mode:
		python path/to/flask_app.py PORT_NUM  (e.g. "python ./flask_app.py 8000")
	b. Run with debug = False:
		python path/to/flask_app.py PORT_NUM  0 (e.g. "python ./flask_app.py 8000 0")
